/*
Yes, this method is thread-safe.
Reason:
 
It’s a pure function — no shared state, no modification of any class-level or static variables.
 
Each call to add() operates only on the inputs a and b, and returns a new result.
 
There are no side effects or shared mutable data, so multiple threads calling this method
simultaneously won't interfere with each other.
