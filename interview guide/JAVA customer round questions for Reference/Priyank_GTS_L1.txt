Basic intro, previous experience , technology used
2nd larger number find from arraylist, it time and space complexity, and way to increase efficiency
{1,1,1,2,2,2,4,4,5,5,8,8,9,9} find index of the leftmost 5 , in this case is 8
similarly index of right most of 5, here 9 the re time and space complexity, way to improve the efficiency of the program
Factory design pattern, abstract factory design pattern
Cache used in spring boot, reddis
microservice pattern
resiliency pattern
how and why circuit breaker is used, there all concept
if nosql is used?
