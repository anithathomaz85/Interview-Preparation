Interviewer Name : Ayush Bhardwaj

1. Introduction to project
2. Question on DSA - Time complexcity of HashSet and why we need to use it.
3. What is Time Complexity and Space Complexity
4. What is volatile variable and synchronization
5. What is block and function synchronization
6. What is inheritance and polymorphism and write code with example
7. What is heap memory and garbage collection
8. Different types of garbage collection and how they are different from each other.
9. What is Transitive dependency
10. Write a program to find the next big element in a give array and explain time complexity
Input : {2,6,3,4,9,1,10};
Output : [6,9,4,9,10,10,-1]
11. Write program to sort below array without inbuilt functions and explain time complexity
int[] arr = {2,2,1,0,1,0}; (It requires graph data structure to sort the array)
