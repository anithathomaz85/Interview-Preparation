Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room
You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:
•	If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
•	If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.
Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.
Example 1:
Input: s = "EEEEEEE"
Output: 7
Explanation:
After each second, a person enters the waiting room and no person leaves it. Therefore, a minimum of 7 chairs is needed.
Example 2:
Input: s = "ELELEEL"
Output: 2
Example 3:
Input: s = "ELEELEELLL"
Output: 3
