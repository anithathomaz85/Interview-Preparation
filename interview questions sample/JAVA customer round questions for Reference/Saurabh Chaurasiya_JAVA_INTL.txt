1. Introduction
2. Working of HashMap
3. why size of bucket is 16 always can we customize it?
4. Can we create customize HashMap, explanation.
5. worst and best case of putting and fetching operation in HashMap.
6. How can we optimized HashMap operation in worst case.
7. Normalization
8. Disadvantage of normalization.
9. Hibernate why you use hibernate.
10. Reverse alphanumeric and special character string ("ajsggs^%@$#@71552") without using any built in method (valueOf(), chartAt(), toCharArray())
11. If there is hash collision on every put operation then what will be the time complexity and how we can optimized.
12. Why organizations are still using JDBC over ORM tools.
13. If there is data in HashMap(like A=1,B=2,C=3,D=4) and if we are trying to insert/put same keys in different order having same hashcode
 but equality is false then what will happen and in this case what will be the time complexity.
(in question 13 what will be the time complexity if we are trying to fetch 'A')
