how a JWT token issued from UserService is used in other microservices
======================================================================

stateless
The server does not store any session information about the user.
All this info is embedded inside the token‚Äîso the server doesn‚Äôt need to store it.

1. Login in UserService
	User sends credentials ‚Üí UserService verifies them.
	JWT is created 
	JWT is sent back to the client (e.g., frontend app).
	This token contains all the necessary user data (like userId, roles, etc.) and is self-contained.
	All this info is embedded inside the token‚Äîso the server doesn‚Äôt need to store it.


2.Calling Other Services
	The client now includes the JWT token in the Authorization header when calling other services:
	GET /employee/profile
	Authorization: Bearer <JWT-TOKEN>

3.Validation in Other Services 
	Each microservice does two things:
		Validates the JWT using a shared secret or public key.
		Extracts the claims (e.g., user ID, role, expiration time, etc.) and uses them in its business logic.
		Then they read information inside the JWT (like the user's ID, role, or email).
		Based on this info, they decide what the user is allowed to do or what data to show the user.

4. Usage in Business Logic
	After extracting the userId from the token, services can:
	Get employee data from DB
	Personalize responses
	Enforce role-based access

@GetMapping("/profile")
public ResponseEntity<Employee> getProfile(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String userId = (String) request.getAttribute("userId");
    return ResponseEntity.ok(employeeService.getByUserId(userId));
}



üßç Real-Life Analogy (Security Gate Pass)
Imagine you're visiting an office building:
At the main gate, you're issued a visitor pass (JWT) with:
	Your name
	The company you're visiting
	The time the pass expires
When you reach different office rooms (microservices):
	They don‚Äôt ask for your ID again.
	They just scan your visitor pass (JWT).
	If it's valid, they let you in and maybe guide you based on your details (e.g., showing you to the right floor).
